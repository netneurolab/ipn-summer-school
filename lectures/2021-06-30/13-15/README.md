# Welcome to time series analysis lecture!

In this session we will learn about basics of time series analysis, forecasting, and classification. We will also perform hands-on analysis using Python and Google Colab.

## Requirements:
### Using Google Colab
We will use Google Colab to run the demo during the practical session. You can also run the demo locally if you have Python and jupyter-notebook installed locally.

If you want to use Google Colab to run the demo:

1. You will need a Google account.
2. Download the **epilepsy.csv** from this repo and upload it to your main Google Drive folder.
3. To open and run the notebooks or to only visualize the notebook click on the links below:
